## Main interests

- How to use AI on our daily lives. I want to be knowledgeable of new novel ways we can use AI.
- Software Engineering practices and techniques
- Business top news related with Tech companies. Those news one cannot ever miss

I'm not interested in very technical Machine Learning details or heavy and brainy computer science.

Regardless of my main interests, I still want to make sure I get news that are very relevant or impactful for a Senior Software Engineer like me.

My goal is to stay current and make sure I progress in my career. I also want for my career to be fun.
