# Tech Newsletters Summary

Used in Claude AI to generate a web page artifact.

Copy & paste the prompt in (./prompt.md) then copy & paste the HTML template in (./html-template) as is, which should be included as an attachment.

I generated the template by running the prompt and then asking for refinements. Once the artifact looked good enough, I asked to generate the template with:

```
Generate an html code template to use in a prompt for making sure I can generate this artifact using same style, format and structure in the future.
```
