Requirements:
- Get ALL unread entries in the specified timeframe by paginating through results until complete
- Read full content for each email thread to capture complete information
- Generate a well-organized web page using the template below (enclosed in //TEMPLATE lines) that presents:

STRUCTURE:

2. Newsletter summaries in chronological order (oldest first) with:
   - Title, author, date, and permalink to original post
   - 2-3 sentence summary of main content
   - Key insights section with 3-4 bullet points of actionable takeaways
   - Referenced tools/links mentioned in the article
